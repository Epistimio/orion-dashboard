This code provides a common Orion dashboard to display experiments and benchmarks.

Orion Dashboard is heavily based on
`Carbon's React Tutorial <https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/developing/react-tutorial/overview>`_.

===========================
Oríon Dashboard (Prototype)
===========================

Orion Dashboard for experiments
-------------------------------

This is a very preliminary prototype of a dashboard for Oríon. Most of it are
just place-holders and static data to show visualizations.

===============================
Dashboard for Oríon's Benchmark
===============================

Oríon's `benchmark <https://orion.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/benchmark.html>`_ makes it easy
to execute multiple hyperparameter optimization algorithms on several tasks. You can
assess the average result over multiple runs of the algorithms or automatically benchmark
how well they parallelize to large pools of workers. It quickly becomes difficult however to
analyse all the data generated by these benchmarks, as large number of tasks and assessments can lead to
hundreds of potential plots. It can also be challenging to track the progress of hundreds of experiments,
each consisting of hundreds of trials. This dashboard serves as a centralized interface to visualize
the results of the benchmarks and to monitor their progress.

============
Installation
============


This dashboard uses React and Carbon. You will need to install npm first, and then yarn.

.. code-block:: console

   npm install --global yarn

Install all dependencies including Carbon.

.. code-block:: console

   yarn

Run in Development Mode
-----------------------

You can start the server with

.. code-block:: console

   yarn start

The first time will take a few minutes while everything gets compiled.

Full Build for Production
-------------------------

You can build and optimize the application with

.. code-block:: console

   yarn build

Running the Production Build
----------------------------

To run the production build of the dashboard, first install ``serve``

.. code-block:: console

   npm install -g serve

Then start the dashboard server:

.. code-block:: console

   serve -s build

From your Web browser connect to localhost:3000 .

Building Containerized Application
----------------------------------

First, do the full production build (see above). 

Use the included Dockerfile with docker/podman to build a containerized version of the Oríon Dashboard.

.. code-block:: console

   docker build -t orion-dashboard

Start the dashboard with the following command:

.. code-block:: console

   docker run -p 3000:3000 orion-dashboard

Once started, connect to the dashboard from your browser by going to localhost:3000
